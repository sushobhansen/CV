## My Curriculum Vitae

This document contains my CV. It is written in LaTeX and updated regularly. I got ideas for formatting this from [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume).

### Important points:
1. In the preamble, I've defined special styles for section and subsections headings. Just define \section and \subsection as usual in the document for them to be formatted right. 
2. In the preamble, I've set links to be blue without underline.
3. In the preamble, I've only changed the default header with a fancy one. The default footer is still there. To turn it off, add \fancyhf{} after \pagestyle{fancy}. 
4. amsmath is there just in case, it's not used (yet). $\circ$ doesn't need amsmath. 

### Formatting tips:
1. No full-stops in Education, publication lists, conference lists, and presentations list.
2. Full stops in all "paragraph" sections, like experience, awards, and leadership.
3. Space on either side of the hyphen in month-to-month dates (e.g., June 2007 - July 2008), but no space in case of dates within a month (e.g., July 11-12, 2012) (but space after the comma always).
