\section*{Research Experience}
\subsection*{University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}
\textbf{Role of Pavements in Urban Energetics} \hfill August, 2015 - Present \\
Doctoral dissertation on the assessment of the local microclimatic impact of pavements on urban areas for improved sustainability. I modified an aging albedo model into a form that could easily be calibrated at any location and developed a statistical model to predict the thermal and optical properties of asphalt and concrete. I developed a pavement-urban canyon Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and used it to study the local microclimate in Power Ranch, AZ. My work provided pavement engineers with tools to evaluate the benefits of engineering interventions at a microscale to mitigate the impact of pavements on the surrounding environment in urban areas.\\

\textbf{Preservation Sustainability Assessment Tool} \hfill August, 2017 - August, 2018\\
Developed the Heat Island analysis component of a Preservation Sustainability Assessment Tool for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). This involved applying methods from my previous research to quantify the heat island impact of pavement preservation solutions for all 50 states in the US, and integrating the results into an Excel-based tool. This was done in collaboration with researchers from the University of Illinois and Michigan State University. \\

\textbf{Improving Metacognition in a Geometric Design Class} \hfill January, 2018 - May, 2018\\
Conducted a teaching effectiveness evaluation study for CEE 415 Geometric Design of Roads to demonstrate how metacognition could be improved by designing a class project around autonomous vehicles. Working in multi-disciplinary teams, students were required to develop new design criteria by critically analyzing existing ones and reading the latest literature, and then implement their new criteria in their projects. Collected data to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving metacognition and meeting ABET accreditation requirements. \\

\textbf{Impact of Concrete Pavements on Urban Heat Island} \hfill August, 2013 - August, 2015 \\
Master's thesis on the determination of the impact of pavement surface and sub-surface structure and materials on the Urban Heat Island. During this research, I developed a new method to measure the albedo of pavements in the field, and developed one of the first aging albedo models for asphalt pavements. I developed a numerical pavement heat transfer model and devised new metrics to quantify the microscale impact of pavements on UHI. My thesis has been published in the form of three first-author, peer-reviewed conference publications and two first-author peer-reviewed journal articles, as well as several follow-on publications.\\

\subsection*{Technical University Munich, Germany}
\textbf{Image-Assisted Total Station} \hfill May, 2012 - July, 2012 \\
Summer research internship on integrating the subsystems of an Image-Assisted Total Station (IATS) and calibrating it using image processing algorithms and least squares fitting. Included development of a C++ program to control the IATS subsystems and calibration from laboratory tests. The IATS and the calibration algorithm I developed can be used for rapid surveying and observation of natural and built-up environment.\\
